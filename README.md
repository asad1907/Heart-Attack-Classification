# **Heart-Attack-Classification**

Heart Attack Analysis &amp; Prediction 



# About the Dataset

1. age - age in years

2. sex - sex (1 = male; 0 = female)

3. cp - chest pain type (0 = typical angina; 1 = atypical angina; 2 = non-anginal pain; 3 = asymptomatic)

4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6. fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)

7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy)

8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved

9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping)

12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

13. thal - 0 = NULL; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = normal; 3 = reversable defect

14. output : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
